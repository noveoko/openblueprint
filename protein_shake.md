Longevity Mix Blood Orange Recipe (Single Serving)
Ingredients (per 14.55 g serving)
Glucosamine Sulfate: 770 mg
Taurine: 1556.5 mg
Calcium Alpha-Ketoglutarate (AKG): 1618.16 mg (provides ~423.79 mg Calcium)
Creatine: 2260.05 mg
Glutathione (Reduced): 354 mg
Glycine: 1432.16 mg
Hyaluronic Acid: 123.2 mg
Magnesium: 169.2 mg (source not specified, e.g., magnesium citrate or oxide)
Sodium: 18.35 mg (source not specified, e.g., sodium chloride or naturally occurring)
Vitamin C (as Ascorbic Acid): 250.55 mg
Lysine HCl: 1333.69 mg
Blood Orange Flavoring: Quantity not specified (use to taste, ~1-2 g for natural flavor powder)
Optional Sweetener: Not listed in COA (use to taste, e.g., stevia or monk fruit, if desired)
Optional Filler/Carrier: To reach 14.55 g total (e.g., maltodextrin or citric acid, ~2-3 g)
Equipment
Precision scale (for accurate measurement of ingredients)
Mixing bowl or blender
Measuring spoons
Airtight container for storage
Glass or shaker bottle for serving
Instructions
Measure Ingredients:
Using a precision scale, weigh each ingredient to the specified amount (e.g., 770 mg Glucosamine Sulfate, 1556.5 mg Taurine, etc.).
Ensure accuracy, as some ingredients (e.g., Glutathione, Hyaluronic Acid) are used in small quantities.
Combine Ingredients:
In a clean, dry mixing bowl, add all measured ingredients.
If using a powdered blood orange flavoring, add ~1-2 g (adjust to taste). If a liquid flavor is preferred, add it during the mixing step below.
Add a filler (e.g., maltodextrin or citric acid) to reach a total weight of 14.55 g, if needed.
Mix Thoroughly:
Stir the ingredients manually with a spoon or use a dry blender to ensure a uniform powder mix.
If using a liquid blood orange flavor, mix it in after dissolving the powder in water (see step 5).
Store:
Transfer the mixed powder to an airtight container to maintain freshness and prevent moisture absorption.
Store in a cool, dry place.
Prepare the Drink:
Add one serving (14.55 g) of the powder to 8-12 oz (240-360 mL) of cold water or your preferred liquid.
Stir or shake well until fully dissolved.
If using liquid blood orange flavoring, add a few drops to the water before mixing in the powder.
Optionally, add ice for a refreshing drink.
Serve:
Consume immediately after mixing for optimal taste and nutrient stability.
Notes
Flavoring: The COA does not specify the exact quantity or type of blood orange flavoring. Use a natural blood orange powder or extract and adjust to taste. Citric acid can enhance the tangy flavor.
Fillers: The COA accounts for 14.55 g total weight, but the listed ingredients sum to ~10.9 g. The remaining ~3.6 g may include flavoring, fillers, or other unlisted excipients. Adjust with a neutral filler like maltodextrin if needed.
Sourcing Ingredients: Ensure high-purity, food-grade ingredients (e.g., Glucosamine Sulfate, Taurine, Creatine Monohydrate) from reputable suppliers. The COA confirms low microbial counts, absence of pathogens, and no detectable pesticides, aflatoxins, or glyphosate, so prioritize clean sources.
Safety: Consult a healthcare professional before consuming, especially if you have medical conditions or are on medications, as some ingredients (e.g., Creatine, Calcium AKG) may interact with certain conditions.
Texture: The mix should dissolve well in water. If it clumps, consider adding a small amount of citric acid or using a shaker bottle.
Scaling: To make a larger batch, multiply each ingredient by the number of servings desired (e.g., for 10 servings, use 7700 mg Glucosamine Sulfate, 15565 mg Taurine, etc.).
Nutritional Profile (per 14.55 g serving, based on COA)
Calcium: 423.79 mg
Magnesium: 169.2 mg
Sodium: 18.35 mg
Vitamin C: 250.55 mg
Other ingredients (e.g., Creatine, Taurine) are not typically listed as nutrients but contribute to the functional benefits.
Recommended Replacement for Longevity Protein
To find a suitable replacement for the "Longevity Protein" by Blueprint Bryan Johnson on Amazon, the product must match the key characteristics from the Certificate of Analysis (COA):
Protein Content: At least 26 g per 47.4 g serving (~55% protein by weight).
Microbial Safety: Low microbial counts (Yeast: 20 CFU/g, Mold: <10 CFU/g, Total Aerobic Microbial Count: 100 CFU/g, no E. coli, Salmonella, or Staphylococcus aureus).
Contaminants: No detectable pesticides (including glyphosate, LOD < 0.1 ppm), no aflatoxins (<5 ppb), low heavy metals (Arsenic: 0.061 ppm, Cadmium: 0.048 ppm, Lead: 0.021 ppm, Mercury: 0.010 ppm).
Additional Nutrients: Contains Calcium (103.64 mg), Iron (5.69 mg), and Potassium (262.52 mg) per serving.
Recommended Product
Transparent Labs 100% Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate
Product Details
Product: Transparent Labs 100% Grass-Fed Whey Protein Isolate
Link: Search "Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate" on Amazon.com
Protein Content: 28 g per 32 g serving (87.5% protein by weight).
Source: 100% grass-fed whey protein isolate, sourced from cows free of hormones and antibiotics.
Microbial Safety: Third-party tested by independent labs (e.g., Ellipse Analytics) for microbial contaminants, ensuring low counts and absence of pathogens like E. coli and Salmonella.
Contaminants:
Pesticides: No detectable pesticides or glyphosate, confirmed by independent testing.
Aflatoxins: Likely negligible based on high purity standards and third-party testing (comparable to COA’s <5 ppb).
Heavy Metals: Top 10% for heavy metal purity among 150+ protein powders tested. Trace amounts of lead (0.2567 µg/serving) and cadmium (1.32787 µg/serving) are below California Prop 65 thresholds, comparable to COA when adjusted for serving size.
Additional Nutrients: Contains minimal naturally occurring minerals (e.g., Calcium, Potassium), though exact amounts vary.
Certifications: Transparent Labs provides certificates of analysis, free of artificial sweeteners, dyes, and preservatives.
Taste and Mixability: Rated 5/5 for taste and solubility, with flavors like Milk Chocolate and Cinnamon Toast Crunch.
Price: ~$1.50–$2.00 per serving (30-serving tub, ~$59.99 on Amazon).
Amazon Reviews: Typically 4.5+ stars with thousands of reviews for quality, taste, and effectiveness.
Comparison to Longevity Protein
Protein Content: 28 g per 32 g (87.5%) vs. 26 g per 47.4 g (54.8%). Transparent Labs is more protein-dense.
Microbial Safety: Both meet stringent microbial standards with third-party testing.
Contaminants: Matches COA’s absence of pesticides and glyphosate. Heavy metals are slightly higher but below safety thresholds.
Additional Benefits: Low-lactose whey isolate, suitable for dairy sensitivities. Grass-fed source may enhance omega-3/omega-6 ratio.
Drawbacks: Slightly higher cost, but justified by purity. Mineral content not detailed, but secondary to protein focus.
Why This Over Others?
Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey: Contains artificial flavors/sweeteners, less clean profile.
Paleovalley Bone Broth Protein: Only 17–21 g protein per serving, more expensive ($2.30/serving).
Plant-Based Options (e.g., Ora Organic, PlantFusion): Higher heavy metal content, lower protein (20–22 g).
Alternative Option (Plant-Based)
Truvani Organic Plant-Based Protein Powder
Protein Content: 21 g per ~30 g serving.
Microbial Safety: Third-party tested for microbial contaminants and pathogens.
Contaminants: Certified organic, non-GMO, tested for heavy metals, pesticides, and glyphosate (Prop 65 compliant).
Taste: High ratings for Chocolate and Vanilla flavors.
Price: ~$1.50–$2.00 per serving on Amazon.
Drawbacks: Lower protein content, potential for trace heavy metals (common in plant-based powders).
How to Purchase
Visit Amazon.com and search for "Transparent Labs Whey Protein Isolate" (or "Truvani Plant-Based Protein" for vegan).
Check pricing and flavor options (e.g., Milk Chocolate, Vanilla).
Verify seller (e.g., Transparent Labs or Amazon directly).
Request recent COA from manufacturer for microbial/contaminant specs if needed.
Notes
Serving Size Adjustment: Transparent Labs’ 32 g serving delivers more protein, so use less powder per shake.
